Labeling each day's stock as a summarative score of positive or negative sentiment values from tweets of that day, we used a combination of the summarative score along with other features including the volume, open, high, and low prices of the stock market in an LSTM model. 
Overall, the model was decently accurate, but unfortunately did not preform better than guessing the previous day's stock value.
